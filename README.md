## Overall Learning 

During my internship at Sure Trust, I focused on bridging the gap between static design and dynamic functionality. I sharpened my skills in HTML and CSS to create responsive layouts and used JavaScript to add logic and interactivity. A significant part of my training involved React, where I learned to build reusable components and manage application state, along with using JSON for structuring and handling data. It was a practical, hands-on experience that gave me confidence in the full development lifecycle.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: E-Commerce Website(bewkoof.com)Clone</h3>
<p>
 Bewakoof Clone – Frontend E-commerce Project: I designed and developed this single-page application (SPA) to practice building scalable React modules. The project shows the core functionality of the Bewakoof fashion platform.
 Key implementations include:
 Redux Toolkit for managing complex state (Cart, User Auth, Wishlist).
 React Router for seamless navigation between finding products and checking out.
 Responsive CSS to ensure the app feels native on both desktop and mobile.
 API Integration for fetching dynamic product data and handling search queries.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
LST and SST sessions helped me...
Beyond the coding projects, these sessions helped me shape my professional personality. I gained a better understanding of work ethics, leadership, and negotiation. The tech-focused sessions on prompt engineering were also a highlight—teaching me how to use AI tools smartly to improve my efficiency without relying on them blindly.
